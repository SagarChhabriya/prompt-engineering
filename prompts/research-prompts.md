### 2. Prompt to Paraphrase the Summary

Take the following output and rephrase it to make it sound like it was written by a human. The goal is to make it sound natural, conversational, and not overly formal or mechanical. Use varied sentence structures, and avoid sounding too repetitive or robotic. Ensure that the key points are still there, but make it flow more like a human-written summary or analysis. Focus on clarity and readability, as if someone were explaining it to a peer or a colleague in simple terms.
