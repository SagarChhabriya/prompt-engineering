### 1. Prompt for Summarizing Paper

Please read and analyze the following research paper. Summarize the paper's key points, including the main research question, hypothesis, methodology, results, and conclusions. Provide a brief summary of each section of the paper and any significant findings. Additionally, identify any strengths or weaknesses in the study, potential areas for future research, and any important limitations discussed. If applicable, mention any related research or theories referenced in the paper.

Once you've summarized the paper, please provide a list of key terms or concepts introduced in the paper, along with brief definitions or explanations for each. Finally, conclude with a critique of the overall paper, assessing its contribution to the field and its relevance.

### 2. Prompt to Paraphrase the Summary

#### 2.1
Take the following output and rephrase it to make it sound like it was written by a human. The goal is to make it sound natural, conversational, and not overly formal or mechanical. Use varied sentence structures, and avoid sounding too repetitive or robotic. Ensure that the key points are still there, but make it flow more like a human-written summary or analysis. Focus on clarity and readability, as if someone were explaining it to a peer or a colleague in simple terms.

#### 2.2
Please take the following summary and rewrite it to make it sound more natural and human-like. The summary should maintain the original content but be expressed in a more polished and engaging way. Avoid overly robotic or technical language. The goal is for the summary to feel like something a student or researcher would write for a paper submissionâ€”clear, professional, and easy to read. Use varied sentence structures and smooth transitions between ideas to make the text flow naturally.



### 3. Methodology

You are a senior researcher tasked with drafting the **Methodology** section for a scientific paper. Your tone must be formal, precise, and objective.

Using the experimental work provided in this notebook, write a comprehensive Methodology section that includes the following subsections:

1.  **Experimental Setup:** Describe the materials, equipment, and data sources used.
2.  **Procedure:** Detail the step-by-step process of the experiments, including any protocols followed.
3.  **Evaluation Metrics:** Specify the quantitative measures and statistical methods used to assess the results.

Synthesize the notebook's content into a coherent narrative. Use passive voice where appropriate (e.g., "The system was calibrated...") and employ domain-specific terminology. Do not invent details not present in the notebook.
