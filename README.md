# Prompt-Engineering

Many defend the "your startup is just a GPT wrapper" critique by arguing everything is a wrapper, since most companies build on foundational tech. This misses the point. A "GPT wrapper" implies a business relies entirely on system prompts, lacking a defensible moat. 

Take Cluely, recently backed by a16z for $15M. A leak exposed their app as just system prompts, undermining their defensibility. If they had built proprietary tech or innovative systems, a breach wouldnâ€™t unravel their business. True innovation creates a moat beyond prompts.
